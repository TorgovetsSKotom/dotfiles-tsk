// Any single-image submission will redirect to the full-size image. On multi-image submissions, every page except the first will redirect to its full-size image. 
// If you go "back" to the normal gallery page (to favorite the image, read its description, leave a comment, etc.) then this script will not send you forward again. 
// https://greasyfork.org/scripts/4713-eza-s-image-glutton 



// TO DO: 
// for modify_tumblr: for photoset pages (but everywhere, to be safe) make unlinked images link to themselves. I want nice, clean, chronological tabs for multi-image comics. 
// ugh. test without adblock enabled. 
// modify_furaffinity to change prev/next/fav links with pre-appended #dnr. not raw html fiddling: use the DOM and getElementsByType or whatever. thingy.href=url_plus_dnr. 
// flickr? maybe separately. that whole site is a mess. also full-size images are sometimes gigantic, like dozens of megabytes. 
// inkbunny: move page links above first-page preview on multi-image submissions? - by altering divs or css, if possible. minimal molestation implies better future-proofing. 
	// weasyl: replace bespoke thumbnails with smallest preview images? eh, do these as separate scripts, once userscripts stops fucking around.
// Consider changing some @includes to @match. 
// http://thehentaiworld.com/hentai-doujinshi/theres-something-about-sakura-naruto/ ? I already do rule34; there's no pretending this is just about "art." 
	// Almost deserves a more Pixiv Fixiv-like fix. Maybe just a link dump like that DeviantArt gallery script?
// Swagster.com? Eh. The name alone rubs me the wrong way. Ugh, and they watermark. 
// Greasyfork install page as options page? 
// This would work faster if I could delay or prevent the loading of images. E.g., execute script before loading page, define CSS that doesn't download embedded images, wait for page to load, scrape image_url, and then redirect as usual. Since the script wouldn't trigger on #dnr (which I should do as an @exclude, I guess) images would load as usual when you clicked 'back.' 
	// This thought is mostly driven by opening a bunch of e.g. Gelbooru links all at once. They spend long enough loading that the full-size images are usually half-done before the redirect happens. 
// Getting a generic Pixiv error on http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=46742182 
	// Redirects to http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=manga&illust_id=46693388 
// Escape function in JS is encodeURI. Also use in Tumblr Scraper, where we need 'safe' URLs as tag IDs. 
// FurAffinity stories redirect to thumbnail, e.g. http://www.furaffinity.net/view/15903888/ - might need to break out a whole complex function here. 
// http://seiga.nicovideo.jp/seiga/im4507046 ? 
// Nijie.info support might be missing out on multipage submissions? I don't even have an account. 
	// My Nijie support is basically nonexistant because I didn't have an account. Turns out they're more like Pixiv now, including multi-image posts. This is problematic. (Animations work, though.) 
// This script just went missing from OpenUserJS. WTF? I'm pretty sure I didn't hit the gigantic DELETE SCRIPT button on the "Edit" page. And it won't let me upload a new version from scratch? Fuck you, OUJS. Where's the slightest hint of an "undelete" button, or any log of why my fucking script is missing? 
	// Nope, OUJS mod Marti is just kind of an asshole. I made a thread asking about the missing script, and he told me it'd been "permanently removed" for violating the TOS. Apparently "public domain" isn't open-source enough. Great. So despite all the language stating that MIT will be assumed in the absence of contrary information, I have to specify it in @license... "and one @exclude *"? What does that even mean? 
	// OUJS mod Marti is a _real_ asshole. I can't re-upload this script with the same name, because his slapdash website has salted the earth over the /Ezalias/Ezas_Image_Glutton URL. Again, this is for a licensing issue, where the script was labeled "public domain / no rights reserved" instead of MIT, even though having no license specified would be quietly treated as MIT-licensed. So because my open-source @license was too open, the script is permanently barred, without prior notice or warning of any meaningful sort. He is the kind of unprofessional douchebag who is liable to delete my entire account there if he ever deigns to read this comment. Or for no reason whatsoever! Who knows! Apparently standard operating procedure there is shoot first, ask questions never, and swing your dick in the comments if anyone asks why their content is missing and broken. 
	// Can't upload Eza's Image Gluten and then rename it because the URL changes to match the title. Interesting feature, but terrible even for users who haven't been trolled by the admins, since the failure is silent and ditches whatever code you entered in the online editor. You're dropped back into the editor with the last stored version of the code. That hacky bullshit would be fine if the guy responsible wasn't an egotistical hypocrite demanding "professional conduct" in the threads where he casually mentions he almost deleted your whole account and acts offended when you don't thank him for His undue mercy. No, wait, it's even dumber than that - it creates a new page for the differently-named script. What a shithole. 
// Make undersized images link to themselves on imgur. 
// Eza's image glutton as described on http://cuddle.horse/post/109728993805/a-few-browser-extensions-that-make-furaffinity-a -
	// Ezaâ€™s Image Glutton: This affects websites beyond just FA but is a unique tool for powerbrowsing and such. When you open a page with a single image it skips all comments and descriptions and just shows the image in the highest quality possible. If you want to see all the items that are hidden all you have to do is go back a page.
	// good rundown from a third party. 'A page with a single image' is clearer than 'gallery submission page.' 

// Changed if-else-if rat's nest to switch/case rat's nest. 
// Changed non-image file-extension blacklist to use an actual list. 

// Since I'm just leafing through HTML (usually), can I jump to the image /before/ trying to load the page? GreaseMonkey has a wonky option for running the script before the page runs, but I don't think we get all the HTML first. Maybe... maybe AJAX the page we're on? Like, @RunAtStart or whatever, then create a little blank page, then grab the URL via XmlHTTPgetObject or whatever, then read the HTML as responseText. The trouble (I expect) would be going back to the normal page when someone hits 'back.' This script shouldn't run... but any browser will probably have cached the fake page. 

// Do-before-load, grab page via ajax, and process as text to redirect before DOM even knows what's going on?
	// intent is to fully prevent rendering of images / execution of other JS, to hastily redirect to whatever image URL is required. 
	// Surprisingly, it works! Any site relying on extract-image-url-after is easy to please. 
	// Cons: still not blazing-fast. Probably doubles GET requests to server, though overall bandwidth might be lower. Forces reliance on extract-etc function. 503-fixer seems busted. 
		// Getting "too much recursion" errors in ctrl+shift+j (error console). 503s still boned. 
	// Reverted. It was an interesting idea, but it was added complexity that broke some useful features. (And then broke entirely. Recursion? WTF?) 
	// Can I run-at document-start and then fire a function at document-end? That might allow me to </html> ASAP, killing the page's execution... but then we'd need to reload if we don't redirect. Hm. 
	// Is there JS to prevent the execution of JS? 

// Owyn Tyler has a ridiculously replete script with similar goals called Handy Just Image - http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/166494
// The supported-site list is waaay longer than mine, and/but his goals are more complex. Image Glutton exists only to deliver the image. 
// He's having trouble with back-trapping, though. His solution sounds absurdly complex even compared to mine. Test the script and recommend help if possible.
